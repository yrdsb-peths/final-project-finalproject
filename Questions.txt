Um, hey! I’m Mary!
Well, it’s nice to meet you! It’s not everyday I get visitors. 
So why did you summon me?
You're probably the most interesting person I've met so far.
Anyways, is this what you humans call a date? Ask me something.
My turn! I do like someone who is dependable. What would you do if you saw me upset?
By the way, what are your thoughts on the British Royal Family?  
You know, you’re pretty fun to hang out with. Nobody has taken time to talk to me in years.
Say, do you have any suggestions for passing the time in a mirror? 
Well… It was nice talking to you. It looks like some kids having a sleepover just summoned me.
