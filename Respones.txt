*whimper*
Hello?
AHHHHWFHGRHWF
Haha, right… yeah! Please don’t hurt me. 
Well, it’s not everyday I get to see someone as beautiful as you.
Yeah, I’m surprised you haven’t scratched my eyes out yet.
Uhhh… I didn’t summon you. My sister did. 
My friend told me to do something spontaneous and I wanted to meet someone new. 
Not gonna lie I’m desperate. 
Thanks, my mom tells me the same thing.
And single. You’re pretty cute ;)
Get out of my mirror! *sprays holy water*
