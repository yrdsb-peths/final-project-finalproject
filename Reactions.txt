Ah yes, the typical response.
Hehe, hi!
Hmph, it’s rude to yell at a lady.
Mhm, we’ll see.
Stop, you're so sweet. Quite the charmer aren’t you? 
Ohh, count your blessings. I can do a lot more than that.
But there's no one - oh I see, your sister must be a ghost too!
How courageous of you. I do hope you enjoy my company. 
Desperate for what? Actually, don’t answer that.
I’m sure she does.
Pfft, you’re so corny.
Did you think that would do anything? I’m in a mirror, genius.
I’m in a mirror. There is only the black void.
Ooo, there was that one time when I scared someone so bad they vomited. 
Obviously.
I think that’s sweet of you? Though you don't stand a chance.
Oh… that’s actually kind of thoughtful of you.
Unfortunately, I’m in a mirror. So your gifts would be useless.
That seems to be the common verdict amongst the civilians. 
Ha, we certainly were.
Ew, why? She is totally inferior to me.
Yeah, it kind of does.
Haha, you’re too kind. But really, thanks.
Oh… I thought I looked nice today.
Netflix you say? I’ve never heard of him.
Sounds interesting, witchcraft is up my alley.
Oh no, not the spirits. I’ve talked to them for too long. 
You heard right, I have some frightening to do.
That’s very cute of you. You’ll miss me, huh?
Um… ok.
