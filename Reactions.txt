Ah yes, the typical response.
Hehe, hi!
Hmph, it’s rude to yell at a lady.
Mhm, we’ll see.
Aww, you’re so sweet, stop it! You’re quite the charmer aren’t you. 
Ohh, count your blessings. I can do a lot more than that.
But there does not seem to be anyone else in your room. Oh I see, your sister must be a ghost too!
Oh, that’s quite courageous of you. I do hope you enjoy my company. 
Desperate for what? Actually, don’t answer that.
I’m sure she does.
Pfft, you’re so corny.
Ack, it stings! Just kidding, why would you do that? I’m in a mirror, genius.
