Ah yes, the typical response.
Hehe, hi!
Hmph, it’s rude to yell at a lady.
Mhm, we’ll see.
Aww, you’re so sweet, stop it! You’re quite the charmer aren’t you. 
Ohh, count your blessings. I can do a lot more than that.
But there does not seem to be anyone else in your room. Oh I see, your sister must be a ghost too!
Oh, that’s quite courageous of you. I do hope you enjoy my company. 
Desperate for what? Actually, don’t answer that.
I’m sure she does.
Pfft, you’re so corny.
Ack, it stings! Just kidding, why would you do that? I’m in a mirror, genius.
I’m in a mirror. There is only the black void.
Ooo, there was that time when I scared someone so bad they vomited. It was funny.
Obviously.
I think that’s sweet of you? I don’t think you would stand a chance, though.
Oh… that’s actually kind of thoughtful of you.
Unfortunately, I’m in a mirror. So your gifts would be useless.
That seems to be the common verdict amongst the civilians. 
Ha, we certainly were.
Ew, why? She is totally inferior to me.
Yeah, it kind of does.
Haha, you’re too kind. But really, thanks.
Oh… I thought I looked nice today.
Netflix you say? I’ve never heard of him.
Sounds interesting, witchcraft is up my alley.
Oh no, not the spirits. I’ve talked to them for so long - trust me, they’re dreadful. 
You heard right, I have some frightening to do.
That’s very cute of you. You’ll miss me, huh?
Um… ok.
