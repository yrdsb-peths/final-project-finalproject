Um, hey! I’m Mary!
Well, it’s nice to meet you! It’s not everyday I get visitors. 
So why did you summon me?
You're probably the most interesting person I've met so far.
Is this what you humans call a date? Ask me something.
My turn! What would you do if you saw me upset?
So, what are your thoughts on the British Royal Family?  
Nobody has taken time to talk to me like you have.
Do you have any suggestions for passing the time in a mirror? 
Oh, looks like some kids having a sleepover just summoned me.
