Um, hey! I’m Mary!
Well, it’s nice to meet you! You know, it’s not everyday I get visitors. Mostly, well, you know, the fear of death and all that.
So why did you summon me?
Well, I’ve been doing this job for a while, it’s getting pretty tiring. But you, you’re interesting at least.
Anyways, is this what you humans call a date? I’ve always wanted to try one. Ok, wait, ask me a question now.
My turn! I do like someone who is dependable. What would you do if you saw me upset?
By the way, what are your thoughts on the British Royal Family?  
You know, you’re pretty fun to hang out with. Nobody has taken time to talk to me in years.
Say, do you have any suggestions for passing the time in a mirror? Although annoying, humans are quite innovative.
Well… It was nice talking to you. It looks like some kids having a sleepover just summoned me.
