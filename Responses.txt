*whimper*
Hello?
AHHHHWFHGRHWF
Haha, right… yeah! Please don’t hurt me. 
Well, it’s not everyday I get to see someone as beautiful as you.
Yeah, I’m surprised you haven’t scratched my eyes out yet.
Uhhh… I didn’t summon you. My sister did. 
I wanted to meet someone new. 
Not gonna lie I’m desperate. 
Thanks, my mom tells me the same thing.
And single. You’re pretty cute ;)
Get out of my mirror! *sprays holy water*
Nice weather we’re having, huh?
What was your favorite scare?
This is a date?
I would get revenge in your honor!
We could sit and talk about it.
I would buy you gifts to make you happier!
They’re very… peculiar.
They were very powerful back in the day.
Oh, I’m a big fan of Queen Elizabeth!
Oh, that sucks.
That makes two of us. For a spirit, you’ve got personality.
I’m not surprised, you are pretty scary.
I just binged this great show on Netflix. You should try it.
There’s a great book series, Harry Potter.
Play with a Ouija board.
Yea, haha. Wait, what?
So I won’t see you again?
Cool *Walks away*
